# Advanced Writing Features

Master the advanced features that make your documentation professional and effective. Learn about metadata, lead paragraphs, styling contexts, and the best practices that separate great docs from good ones. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Metadata and SEO

Every page should include metadata at the top:

```mdx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Your Page Title',
  description: 'Brief description for SEO and navigation.',
};

;
```

## Lead Paragraphs

Make introductory paragraphs stand out with `{{ className: 'lead' }}`:

```mdx
This is a lead paragraph that introduces the topic with larger, more prominent text. {{ className: 'lead' }}
```

## Styling Context

### The not-prose Class

Use `<div className="not-prose">` for components that need to escape prose styling:

```mdx
<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/somewhere">Click Me</Button>
</div>
```
