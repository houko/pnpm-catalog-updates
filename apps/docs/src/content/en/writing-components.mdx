# Writing Components

Enhance your documentation with interactive UI components. Learn to use Notes for important information, Buttons for actions, and other elements that make your docs more engaging and functional. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Notes and Callouts

The `<Note>` component is perfect for highlighting important information, warnings, or tips that readers should pay special attention to.

### Basic Note Usage

<Note>
  This is a basic note component. It automatically styles content with an emerald theme and info
  icon, making important information stand out from regular text.
</Note>

```mdx
<Note>This is a basic note component with important information.</Note>
```

### Notes with Rich Content

Notes support full Markdown formatting, including **bold text**, _italic text_, `inline code`, and even [links to other pages](/writing-basics).

<Note>
  **Important Setup Requirement**: Before proceeding, ensure you have: - Node.js version 18 or
  higher installed - Access to the project repository - Valid API credentials configured See the
  [Authentication Guide](/authentication) for credential setup.
</Note>

```mdx
<Note>
  **Important Setup Requirement**: Before proceeding, ensure you have: - Node.js version 18 or
  higher installed - Access to the project repository - Valid API credentials configured See the
  [Authentication Guide](/authentication) for credential setup.
</Note>
```

### Multi-paragraph Notes

<Note>
  This is the first paragraph of a longer note that contains multiple pieces of related information.

This second paragraph continues the thought with additional context. You can include as many paragraphs as needed to fully explain the concept.

Remember that good notes are concise but complete, providing just enough information to help readers understand the importance of the message.

</Note>

```mdx
<Note>
  First paragraph with initial information.

Second paragraph with additional context and details.

Final paragraph with summary or next steps.

</Note>
```

## Buttons and Actions

The `<Button>` component creates call-to-action elements that guide users to important links or next steps.

### Button Variants

#### Filled Buttons

Use for primary actions and the most important calls-to-action:

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/writing-code" variant="filled" arrow="right">
    Learn About Code Components
  </Button>
</div>

```mdx
<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/writing-code" variant="filled" arrow="right">
    Learn About Code Components
  </Button>
</div>
```

#### Outline Buttons

Perfect for secondary actions and alternative paths:

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/writing-layout" variant="outline" arrow="right">
    Explore Layout Components
  </Button>
</div>

```mdx
<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/writing-layout" variant="outline" arrow="right">
    Explore Layout Components
  </Button>
</div>
```

#### Text Buttons

Subtle links that blend with content while still standing out:

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/writing-basics" variant="text" arrow="left">
    Back to Basics
  </Button>
</div>

```mdx
<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/writing-basics" variant="text" arrow="left">
    Back to Basics
  </Button>
</div>
```

### Button Arrows

Buttons support directional arrows to indicate navigation:

<div className="not-prose flex gap-4">
  <Button href="#" variant="outline" arrow="left">
    Previous Section
  </Button>
  <Button href="#" variant="filled" arrow="right">
    Next Section
  </Button>
</div>

```mdx
<div className="not-prose flex gap-4">
  <Button href="#" variant="outline" arrow="left">
    Previous Section
  </Button>
  <Button href="#" variant="filled" arrow="right">
    Next Section
  </Button>
</div>
```

### Button Best Practices

- **Use sparingly**: Too many buttons reduce their effectiveness
- **Clear action words**: "Get Started", "Learn More", "View Documentation"
- **Logical hierarchy**: Filled for primary, outline for secondary, text for tertiary
- **Directional arrows**: Left for "back/previous", right for "forward/next"
- **Wrap in not-prose**: Always use `<div className="not-prose">` wrapper

## Component Styling Context

### The not-prose Wrapper

Some components need to escape the default prose styling. Always wrap these components:

```mdx
<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="#" variant="filled">
    Your Button Text
  </Button>
</div>
```

Components that **require** `not-prose`:

- All `<Button>` components
- Custom layout elements
- Interactive widgets
- Complex styled components

Components that **work without** `not-prose`:

- `<Note>` components (self-contained styling)
- Standard Markdown elements
- Text-based components

### Multiple Components

When displaying multiple components together:

<div className="not-prose flex flex-col gap-4">
  <Button href="/writing-api" variant="filled">
    API Documentation Guide
  </Button>
  <Button href="/writing-advanced" variant="outline">
    Advanced Features
  </Button>
  <Button href="/writing-basics" variant="text">
    Review the Basics
  </Button>
</div>

```mdx
<div className="not-prose flex flex-col gap-4">
  <Button href="/writing-api" variant="filled">
    API Documentation Guide
  </Button>
  <Button href="/writing-advanced" variant="outline">
    Advanced Features
  </Button>
</div>
```

## Component Accessibility

All components are built with accessibility in mind:

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper button and link elements
- **ARIA labels**: Screen reader support where needed
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Focus management**: Clear focus indicators
- **Color contrast**: WCAG compliant color schemes

## When to Use Each Component

### Use Notes When:

- Highlighting critical information
- Warning about potential issues
- Providing helpful tips or context
- Explaining prerequisites or requirements
- Calling attention to important changes

### Use Buttons When:

- Guiding to next logical steps
- Linking to external resources
- Creating clear call-to-action moments
- Navigation between major sections
- Highlighting primary actions

### Avoid Overuse:

- Don't use notes for every paragraph
- Limit buttons to 1-2 per section
- Reserve components for truly important content
- Let regular text and Markdown carry most content

## Next Steps

Now that you understand UI components, explore:

- [Writing Code](/writing-code) - Syntax highlighting and code blocks
- [Writing Layout](/writing-layout) - Multi-column layouts and organization
- [Writing API](/writing-api) - API documentation components
- [Writing Advanced](/writing-advanced) - Advanced features and metadata

Master these interactive elements to create documentation that not only informs but guides and engages your readers effectively.
