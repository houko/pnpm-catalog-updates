# Writing Basics

Master the fundamental building blocks of documentation writing. This guide covers standard Markdown syntax, formatting options, and basic elements you'll use in every document. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Markdown Fundamentals

Standard Markdown formatting is fully supported and forms the foundation of all documentation:

**Bold text** for emphasis and importance  
_Italic text_ for subtle emphasis  
`inline code` for technical terms, commands, and short code snippets

You can combine these: **_bold and italic_** or **bold with `code`**

## Text Formatting

### Emphasis and Strong Text

Use asterisks or underscores for emphasis:

```markdown
_This is italic text_
_This is also italic_

**This is bold text**
**This is also bold**

**_This is bold and italic_**
```

### Code and Technical Terms

For inline code, variables, or technical terms, use backticks:

```markdown
Use the `npm install` command to install packages.
Set the `NODE_ENV` variable to `production`.
The `useState` hook manages component state.
```

## Lists and Organization

### Unordered Lists

Perfect for feature lists, requirements, or any non-sequential items:

- Main feature or point
- Another important item
- Third consideration
  - Nested sub-point
  - Additional sub-detail
- Back to main level

### Ordered Lists

Use for step-by-step instructions, procedures, or prioritized items:

1. First step in the process
2. Second step with important details
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step with specific instructions
   2. Another sub-step
4. Final step

### Task Lists

Great for checklists and progress tracking:

- [x] Completed task
- [x] Another finished item
- [ ] Pending task
- [ ] Future enhancement

## Links and Navigation

### Internal Links

Link to other pages in your documentation:

```markdown
See our [Quick Start Guide](/quickstart) for setup instructions.
Check the [API Reference](/api) for complete endpoint details.
```

Examples:

- [Authentication Guide](/authentication)
- [Error Handling](/errors)
- [SDK Documentation](/sdks)

### External Links

Link to external resources:

```markdown
Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) for source code.
Read the [official docs](https://example.com/docs).
```

### Anchor Links

Link to specific sections within pages:

```markdown
Jump to [Text Formatting](#text-formatting) section above.
See [Best Practices](#best-practices) below.
```

## Headings and Structure

Create clear document hierarchy with proper heading levels:

```markdown
# Page Title (H1 - used automatically from metadata)

## Main Section (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

#### Detail Section (H4)

##### Minor Section (H5)

###### Smallest Section (H6)
```

### Heading Best Practices

- Use H1 only for page title (handled by metadata)
- Start sections with H2, subsections with H3
- Don't skip heading levels (no H2 → H4)
- Keep headings descriptive and scannable
- Use sentence case: "Getting started" not "Getting Started"

## Quotes and Callouts

### Blockquotes

For important quotes or references:

> "Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self."  
> — Damian Conway

> **Important Note**: This is a highlighted quote with additional context that spans multiple lines and provides crucial information.

### Multi-paragraph Quotes

> This is the first paragraph of a longer quote.
>
> This is the second paragraph that continues the thought with additional detail and context.

## Horizontal Rules

Separate major sections with horizontal rules:

```markdown
---
```

Creates a visual break:

## Tables

Simple tables for structured data:

| Feature   | Basic | Pro      | Enterprise |
| --------- | ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| Users     | 10    | 100      | Unlimited  |
| Storage   | 1GB   | 10GB     | 100GB      |
| API Calls | 1,000 | 10,000   | Unlimited  |
| Support   | Email | Priority | 24/7 Phone |

### Table Alignment

Control column alignment:

| Left Aligned | Center Aligned | Right Aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Text         |      Text      |          Text |
| More content |  More content  |  More content |

## Special Characters

Use backslashes to escape special Markdown characters:

```markdown
\*Not italic\*
\`Not code\`
\# Not a heading
```

## Line Breaks and Spacing

- End lines with two spaces for hard breaks
- Use empty lines to separate paragraphs
- Use `\` at line end for breaks in lists

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered these basics, explore:

- [Writing Components](/writing-components) - Interactive UI elements
- [Writing Code](/writing-code) - Code blocks and syntax highlighting
- [Writing Layout](/writing-layout) - Multi-column layouts and organization
- [Writing API](/writing-api) - API documentation components
- [Writing Advanced](/writing-advanced) - Advanced features and best practices

These fundamentals form the foundation of all great documentation. Master them first, then build upon them with the advanced components and techniques covered in the other guides.
