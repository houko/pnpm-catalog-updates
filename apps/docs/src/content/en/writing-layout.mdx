# Writing Layout

Create sophisticated layouts that enhance readability and user experience. Learn to use Row and Col components for multi-column designs, sticky positioning, and effective content organization. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Two-Column Layout

Use `<Row>` and `<Col>` for side-by-side content:

<Row>
  <Col>
    **Left Column**
    
    This content appears in the left column. Perfect for explanations, descriptions, or complementary information.
    
    - Key point one
    - Important detail
    - Additional context
  </Col>
  
  <Col>
    **Right Column**
    
    ```javascript
    // Right column with code
    const example = {
      feature: "multi-column",
      benefit: "better organization"
    };
    ```
  </Col>
</Row>

```mdx
<Row>
  <Col>Left column content with explanations.</Col>

  <Col>Right column content with examples.</Col>
</Row>
```

## Sticky Column Layout

Make content stick while scrolling:

<Row>
  <Col>
    **Scrolling Content**
    
    This is regular content that scrolls normally. You can put long explanations here that users will scroll through to read completely.
    
    This column contains the main narrative or detailed information that requires scrolling to consume fully.
  </Col>
  
  <Col sticky>
    **Sticky Reference**
    
    ```json
    {
      "status": "sticky",
      "position": "fixed",
      "scroll": "independent"
    }
    ```
    
    This stays visible as you scroll.
  </Col>
</Row>

```mdx
<Row>
  <Col>Regular scrolling content here.</Col>

  <Col sticky>This column stays fixed while scrolling.</Col>
</Row>
```

## Layout Best Practices

- Use two-column layouts for complementary content
- Sticky columns work best for reference material
- Keep columns balanced in content length
- Ensure mobile responsiveness (columns stack on small screens)
